# Authentication Fix Documentation

## Issues Fixed

1. **Users could login without email confirmation**
   - Modified `auth.ts` to completely separate signup and login processes
   - Updated `AuthContext.tsx` to always redirect to login page after signup

2. **Confirmation emails linked to localhost:3000**
   - Updated `site_url` in `supabase/config.toml` to use `https://www.moscownpur.in`
   - Added production domains to `additional_redirect_urls` in the config

## Code Changes

### 1. Updated `src/lib/auth.ts`

Modified the signup function to never store user data during signup and always require login after signup:

```typescript
// Always return requiresConfirmation: true to force login after signup
// Don't store any user data during signup
return {
  success: true,
  message: 'Please check your email to confirm your account before signing in.',
  requiresConfirmation: true
};
```

### 2. Updated `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

Simplified the signup function to always redirect to login page:

```typescript
// Show confirmation message for new signups
toast.success(result.message);

// Always redirect to login page after signup
window.location.href = '/login';
```


  
```

### 3. Updated `supabase/config.toml`

Changed the site URL and added production domains to redirect URLs:

```toml
# The base URL of your website. Used as an allow-list for redirects and for constructing URLs used
# in emails.
site_url = "https://www.moscownpur.in"
# A list of *exact* URLs that auth providers are permitted to redirect to post authentication.
additional_redirect_urls = ["https://www.moscownpur.in", "https://moscownpur.in"]
```

## Important: Remote Supabase Configuration

The changes to `config.toml` only affect your local development environment. To fix the confirmation email links in production, you need to update your remote Supabase project settings:

1. Log in to the [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.io)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Authentication â†’ URL Configuration
4. Update the Site URL to `https://www.moscownpur.in`
5. Add `https://www.moscownpur.in` and `https://moscownpur.in` to the Redirect URLs
6. Save changes

## Verifying the Fix

1. Create a new test user account
2. Verify that you receive a confirmation email with links to `https://www.moscownpur.in` (not localhost)
3. Verify that you cannot log in until you confirm your email
4. After confirming your email, verify that you can log in successfully
