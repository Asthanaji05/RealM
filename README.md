Welcome to the eWorld Creator Project 🚀
🌟 Vision
eWorld Creator is a creative worldbuilding and storytelling SaaS platform.
We are building a Narrative Operating System where creators can design Worlds, Characters, Regions, Timelines, and Scenes — all interlinked to maintain story consistency.

The goal is simple:
To let users create their own comic-universe style worlds where stories, characters, and events are deeply connected — not just random chapters.

🎯 Core Concept
Worlds & Regions → Define your universe’s geography and realms.

Characters → Build rich profiles with origins, traits, and evolution.

Timeline → The backbone of the story; all events and scenes are placed here.

Scenes → Detailed moments linked to events, with:

Character roles & states

Dialogue & narration system (like comics/screenplays)

Interlinked Storytelling → No disconnected chapters; everything connects through the timeline.

💡 Current Status

🧠 Key Takeaway
We’re not building “just a writing app.”
We’re building a structured creative playground where users can design and manage their entire fictional universe — visually, interactively, and with deep connections.
