🎮 MOSCOWNPUR: GAMIFIED PLATFORM FLOW

1. ✨ First Entry (Onboarding = Lore Introduction)

The user begins in a snowy forest. The Fog Dragon’s whispers echo:
“All forgotten things return to me…”

Suddenly, Moscowvitz appears, glowing with protective aura.
Dialogue prompt (gamified tutorial):

> “Traveler, you’ve crossed into Moscownpur — the last bastion of imagination. To survive here, you must give form to your ideas. Tell me, what name shall your first world bear?”



User creates their first “World” → unlocks The Chronicle Spire (World Architecture tool).



---

2. 🏛 The Chronicle Spire (World Builder)

Tutorial task: “Place the foundation of your story.”

User builds hierarchy (World → Chapters → Events → Scenes).

Gamified framing: Each addition adds a glowing crystal shard to the Spire, and the tower visibly grows taller.

Side lore: Spire is guarded by quill-spirits that record every timeline.



---

3. 🌙 The Character Wells (Character Creation)

Luna introduces this section:

> “Every world is only as alive as its people. Here, dreams take shape.”



User creates a character: origin, traits, goals.

Gamified effect: The character rises from shimmering water and greets the creator.

The more details added, the more vivid the apparition (basic silhouette → full form).



---

4. 🔮 The Scene Forges (Scene Builder)

Moscowvitz explains:

> “A character without a moment is but a shadow. Let us forge their story.”



User combines visuals, dialogue, and objectives to craft a Scene.

Gamified transition: The hammer of the forge rings, and the scene comes alive like a moving mural panel.



---

5. 🧠 The AI Oracles (AI Assistance)

In-world, they appear as glowing masks that whisper options:

“Perhaps they say this…” (Dialogue suggestion)

“A forest at night, filled with wolves…” (Scene prompt)


Gamified: Choosing an Oracle suggestion causes it to “burn into the Chronicle Spire,” saving time while deepening lore.



---

6. 📚 The Memory Vaults (Version Control)

Luna warns:

> “The Fog Dragon thrives on forgotten drafts. But here, nothing is lost.”



Old versions appear as ghostly echoes of scenes/characters, which the user can revisit or restore.



---

7. 🤝 The Grand Assembly (Collaboration Hub)

Framed as a council chamber, with creators entering as avatars (dreamers).

Polls = Council votes.

Shared editing = “Binding of minds.”

Moscowvitz acts as a guide + moderator NPC.



---

8. 🚪 The Gate of Many Exits (Publishing)

When a user exports/publishes, the scene plays as a magical ritual.

Pages of books, glowing murals, and orbs of sound fly out through portals.

Each export = “sending a spark of Moscownpur into the human world.”



---

9. 🐉 The Fog Dragon Challenge (Gamified Motivation Loop)

If creators abandon projects for too long, the Fog Dragon stirs.

In-game notifications appear:
“The Fog Dragon claws at your unfinished tale…”

Returning to work = “strengthening the barriers of Moscownpur.”



---

🚀 Outcome

Every feature = an in-world structure.
Every action = an act of guardianship against forgetting.
Creators = heroes in the same myth as Moscowvitz & Luna.
